    <p style="background-color: yellow; color: red;">Swffy is under development, and this client requires a Swffy server on port 5000, the default for Flask. Do not ask about this!</p>

    <h1>Why not Flashpoint?</h1>
    <p>Flashpoint is most commonly used with a program/app, and I wanted to use it on web. Also, I'm pretty bored and wanted to do something cool.</p>
    <h1>Where are the games sourced?</h1>
    <p>For the first couple, I'll grab them from Flashpoint (love you flashpoint <3) and will link the source. For user uploads, I'll add a source field once everythings up and running.</p>
